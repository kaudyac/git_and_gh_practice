Alex's Favorite Travel Story

One year, my mom put her foot down. The family was going to be saving money to go to Fiji, and that was that. Fiji was that place my mom had chosen on the globe, when she was little, to visit some day when she was grown up. Now the kids were definitely old enough to handle the plane trip without driving her mad, and Dad was just going to have to deal with it. All year, we tightened our belts. It would all be worth it once we dug our toes into the sand and splashed into the water with our new dive gear and our shiny new certifications. Finally, in the dead of winter, the day arrived when we would board our plane and embark on our adventure.
Nature had different plans.
Denver's "weatherproof" International Airport was covered in several feet of snow. Planes were grounded. Our flight was canceled.
My mom was heartbroken, but being the brilliant woman she was, she'd purchased insurance. She was able to reschedule the family trip for Spring Break, which was important as my younger brother and I were still in high school.
Months passed, and eventually, we let ourselves get excited again.
This time, we were more than ready.

Finally, after several plane trips, we found ourselves in Fiji. Then, after a long bus ride through a torrential downpour and a long ride on a boat, we were on a tiny island called Beqa. It felt almost too familiar to be the other side of the planet. The sand was still sand. The sunset, though, felt like being on Rigel II.

One afternoon, the resort offered an excursion to a natural spring and waterfall, on the island. The whole family joined in, taking pictures of the monkeys in the trees and strange plants on the path. When we reached the waterfall, it felt like seeing a place you've seen the drawing of, but never knew existed in reality. Imagine a Jackalope hopping across your path. It felt like that.

The resort's guide said something about climbing the waterfall to reach the spring at the top, but my mother quickly and loudly told my brother and I that this was not an option. At least, that's what my dad tells me my mom said. Adam and I were already half way up the waterfall, soaked to the bone, and grinning like idiots. The water was so loud that we couldn't possibly have heard our mom shouting for us to get down. My brother and I stuck our heads right into the spring and took several cold, fresh gulps. Grinning, we climbed (and mostly slid) down, back to our parents. Mom was practically purple, she was so scared, but Dad was holding the camera, grinning ear to ear.

I think I'm still grounded, but it was worth it.
