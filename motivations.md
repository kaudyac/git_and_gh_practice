Alex's Motivations

In order to do justice to yourself, you must serve your purpose.

Looking at my resume, it's obvious that I've been searching.

Since about 2012, when I quit college, I have tried just about everything I could get my hands on, searching for a ways that I could serve.

Some stops I made along the way:
1) Legal Assistant
2) Calculus Tutor
3) Anatomy Lab Assistant
4) Stem Cell Research Intern
5) Student President of the Women's Resource Center at Eckerd college
6) Data Entry Clerk
7) Bartender
8) Bar manager
8) Server
10) Busser
11) Host
12) Industrial Artist
13) Receptionist
14) High School Speech and Debate Judge
15) Geek Squad Customer Service Agent
16) Geek Squad Operations Agent
17) Self Employed Body Paint Artist
18) Exotic Dancer
19) Certified Nurses Assistant
20) Samsung Experience Expert


I've worked over 20 jobs since I was 20, and as of this writing, I'm just over 30. My CV is hilarious.

I have also been trying to learn how to code for about ten years. However, brief encounters with Mathematica in college convinced me that computer science was voodoo magic that I would never understand.

It's probably not the most fashionable thing to admit, but I am starting this journey because I am mad.

Yup. Both mad as a hatter and mad as a hornet.

First, I was mad that I couldn't understand something that my exes could understand. It's basic and petty, but it does help me work through problems that I want to give up on. "If that fluffhead can understand this crap, I know I can get it." I know I will move on from this, but for now, it works as a tool to keep me going.

Next, I'm mad at myself. Rather, I was. With meditation I have arrived at a place of determination rather than anger, but anger is where I started. I was mad that I could see myself giving up slowly on many dreams, just looking at my resume. Simply put, I have not been doing myself justice.

Although each step on this journey has been crucial, and this is exactly the place I should be (and luckily want to be), the step of being angry has been necessary to summon the energy to change my own life.

I am built to serve, but how to best serve is the problem I have been trying to solve for ten years.

If there is an industry where I can use my experience as a complete misfit as valuable information to build positive change in the world, software engineering is the best place for me to look.

Ultimately, if there is a way that I can make this industry more accessible to the women I met who needed a leg up, that is what I want to do. My friend Kelsey Cuozzo is in the process of creating a school for women who are homeless, and I am probably going to be looking for ways to be good enough at this to work with her, someday. I would personally like to reach out to dancers, many of whom had invisible chains tying them to the poles, such as family and criminal history. I broke mmy two-year chain by going to school to be a CNA, but I was one of the lucky ones. I don't have kids, and I had the freedom to spend the time and money on school. Although the career didn't work out (tried to kill me sooner than I want), it did save me from that life. There are so many brilliant women who could make a better life for themselves if the resources were available to them.

My purpose in life has been pretty clear since I was younger. I am a puller. I have taught, tutored, and babysat since I was little. I am the person who reaches out on Facebook and offers someone asking the abyss a bed to sleep in for the night and a hot meal. I am the person who goes to concerts alone and stays until all the cars have left, waiting to see if there are any stragglers who cn't afford a cab. I've driven all over Colorado bringing people home. I am that lady who writes detailed glowing reviews of my friends products when they start their business, and spam social media with their progress.

They say that when you need help, reach out. When you don't need help, grab someone who's reaching. I like to think of myself as a slingshot in terms of this metaphor, and that's what I want to keep doing. I want to be a better slingshot, though, and for that, I need to do the work to improve myself.

That's why I'm here.
